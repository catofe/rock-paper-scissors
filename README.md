# Rock Paper Scissors

## Rationale
*(you can skip this part if you don't wanna hear me yap)*

When working alone on software projects, we tend to put little thought in how we implement our program. This usually isn't a big problem given the scale and simplicity of our previous projects. But in a more complex project where collaboration is requirement, it is essential for us to learn how to write code with collaboration and modularity in mind.

Therfore, in this project, we will focus on writing modular code that can easily be called and resused in different parts of the program and this program will be Rock Paper Scissors *(via the terminal/command prompt)*

## Goals
1. Learn basic software development collaboration via github
2. Implement software with modularity in mind
3. Better familiarity with Git and GitHub
